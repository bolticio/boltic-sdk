### Issue #001: Node.js Version Incompatibility

**Status:** ðŸŸ¢  
**Date Logged:** 2025-08-01  
**Reported By:** Foundation Agent  
**Component/Module:** Development Environment  
**Severity:** Critical

#### Problem Description

The development environment was using Node.js v4.4.5 (released 2016) which was incompatible with modern development tools required for this project. All dependencies required Node.js >=14, with many requiring >=16 or >=18.

#### Steps to Reproduce

1. Run `npm install` in the project directory
2. Observe numerous engine warnings and installation failures
3. Run `npm run type-check` or `npm run build`
4. Receive syntax errors due to unsupported ES6+ features

#### Expected Behavior

All npm scripts should run without errors and dependencies should install successfully.

#### Actual Behavior (Initial)

- Hundreds of engine warnings during npm install
- Installation failures for native modules (fsevents, esbuild)
- PostInstall script failures due to unsupported JavaScript syntax
- npm scripts failing with "Unexpected token" errors

#### Environment Details

- **OS:** Darwin 23.0.0 (macOS)
- **Initial Node Version:** v4.4.5 (Released: 2016)
- **Target Node Version:** >=18.0.0 for modern tooling
- **Final Node Version:** v20.18.2 âœ…
- **Final NPM Version:** 11.4.1 âœ…

#### Error Messages/Logs (Initial)

```
SyntaxError: Unexpected token ...
gyp ERR! configure error
npm WARN engine vite@5.4.19: wanted: {"node":"^18.0.0 || >=20.0.0"}
npm WARN engine vitest@1.6.1: wanted: {"node":"^18.0.0 || >=20.0.0"}
npm WARN engine typescript@5.9.2: wanted: {"node":">=14.17"}
```

#### Root Cause Analysis

Node.js v4.4.5 was released in 2016 and lacked:

- ES6+ syntax support (spread operator, async/await, destructuring)
- Modern npm features and security updates
- Compatibility with current tooling ecosystem
- Support for modern JavaScript features used by build tools

#### Solution Implemented

**Node.js successfully upgraded to v20.18.2 using nvm**

**Steps taken:**

1. **Installed nvm (Node Version Manager)**
2. **Upgraded to Node.js v20.18.2** (exceeds >=18.0.0 requirement)
3. **Activated Node.js v20 in shell sessions** using `nvm use 20`
4. **Reinstalled all dependencies** successfully without errors
5. **Configured monorepo structure** with Husky at root level
6. **Fixed Vite configuration** for multiple entry points
7. **Simplified ESLint configuration** for better compatibility
8. **Fixed TypeScript any warnings** for code quality

#### Files Modified

- **Environment:** Node.js runtime upgraded from v4.4.5 â†’ v20.18.2
- **Dependencies:** All packages reinstalled and working
- **databases/vite.config.ts:** Removed UMD format for multiple entry points
- **databases/.eslintrc.js:** Simplified configuration
- **databases/src/errors/utils.ts:** Fixed TypeScript warnings
- **Root package.json:** Created monorepo configuration
- **Root .lintstagedrc.json:** Configured for monorepo structure

#### Testing Performed

**All Foundation Scripts Verified âœ…**

- `npm run type-check` âœ… - TypeScript compilation successful
- `npm run build` âœ… - Vite build creates ESM/CJS outputs
- `npm run lint` âœ… - ESLint passes with no errors
- `npm run format` âœ… - Prettier formatting works
- `npm test` âœ… - Vitest testing framework ready
- `npx husky install` âœ… - Git hooks working at root level

#### Prevention Measures

- âœ… **Added Node.js version requirements** in package.json engines field
- âœ… **Included Node.js prerequisites** in project README
- âœ… **Set up CI/CD pipeline** to test against Node.js 18.x and 20.x
- âœ… **Documented nvm usage** for version management
- âœ… **Created monorepo structure** for proper dependency management

#### Resolution Date

2025-08-01

**Final Status:** âœ… **FULLY RESOLVED** - All development tools working with Node.js v20.18.2
